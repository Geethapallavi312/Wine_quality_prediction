# Wine Quality Prediction Model
This project aims to predict the quality of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" red wine based on various physicochemical properties.

## Project Structure
### Data Import and Exploration

Import the dataset and review its structure.
Check for missing values and summarize basic statistics.
### Data Visualization

Create a correlation matrix to understand variable relationships.
Use visualizations like heatmaps to explore data patterns.
### Outlier Detection

Identify and visualize outliers in the data.
Data Preparation

### Split the dataset into features (independent variables) and target (dependent variable).
Scale the features for uniformity.
Model Building

Train a Linear Regression model to predict wine quality.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following columns representing various chemical properties and the quality score:

Fixed Acidity
Volatile Acidity
Citric Acid
Residual Sugar
Chlorides
Free Sulfur Dioxide
Total Sulfur Dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Quality (score between 0 and 10)
Installation
To run the project, ensure you have Python installed along with libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## Usage
Data Import

Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
Data Visualization

Generate visualizations to explore relationships and patterns in the data.
Outlier Detection

Detect and analyze outliers using appropriate methods.
Data Preparation

Prepare the dataset by splitting and scaling the features.
Model Building

Train and evaluate a Linear Regression model to predict the wine quality.
##  Results
The project demonstrates how to predict wine quality using chemical properties, with model performance evaluated using standard metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
